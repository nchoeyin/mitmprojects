        We believe in three qualities in a student.  First, Knowledge. Syllabus is defined by university and our staffs teach them in classes or online tool, release videos of their lectures in youtube department channel. Students study, pass the exams. Finally, it is attained in every student. Second quality that is expected from an engineer is skill. We train all students in labs so that everyone possesses required skills in industry by believing that an engineer without skill is not an engineer at all. We encourage students to take up certifications from reputed universities of globe and from various IT giants to achieve this. Finally, we focus on building good attitude as one of the quality through proper counselling and regular guidance.
